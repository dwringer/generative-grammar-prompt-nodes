  This generates prompts from simple user-defined grammar rules (loaded
  from custom files - examples provided below). The prompts are made by
  recursively expanding a special template string, replacing nonterminal
  "parts-of-speech" until no more nonterminal terms remain in the
  string.

  As a basic example, the template `{picture} of {subject}` might be
  expanded to `{photoQuality} photo of {person}`, which might
  subsequently expand to `professional photo of Barack Obama` (assuming
  these definitions were present in the lookup table):

  ```
  prompt:
    templates:
      - "{picture} of {subject}"
    picture:
      - sketch
      - cartoon
      - "{photoQuality} photo"
    photoQuality:
      - professional
      - amateur
    subject:
      - "{person}"
    person:
      - Barack Obama
      - George Bush
      - Tom Hanks
      - Rami Malek
  ```

  ### Installation:

  To install these nodes, simply place the folder containing this
  repository's code (or just clone the repository yourself) into your
  `invokeai/nodes` folder.

  Generally, the two methods of installation are:

  - Open a terminal with git access (`git bash` on Windows) in
  your InvokeAI home directory, and `cd` to the `nodes`
  subdirectory. If you installed to `C:\Users\<user
  name>\invokeai\` then you will want your terminal to be open to
  `C:\Users\<user name>\invokeai\nodes\`.  Then simply type:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/dwringer/generative-grammar-prompt-nodes.git
  ```

  - Or, download the source code of this repository as a .zip file by
  clicking the green `<> Code` button above and selecting `Download
  ZIP`, then extract the folder within and place it as a subfolder
  inside the `nodes` folder of your InvokeAI home directory (e.g.,
  `C:\Users\<user name>\invokeai\nodes\generative-grammar-prompt-nodes-master\`)

  There are some example .yaml files here to give some ideas about what
  sort of things are possible. Most of these possibilities are
  illustrated by the file `example_template.yaml`.
